#Serverless app with AWS cognito and DynamoDB
In this laboratory we are trying to create a simple App that uses AWS infrastructure with the following requeriments:
* The application must allow users to register (create an account).
* The application must allow users to authenticate using a password.
* The application must use Cognito to manage user accounts.
* The application must grant integrity and authorization.
* The application implements a minimal facebook-like social network. Every connected user can post messages and every user will see the posted messages. Last posted message is shown on top.
* The application must show how many users are currently connected.
* The application must updated the post feed and the number of connected users in Real-time.
* Access to WS must be secure.
* Implement the simplest minimal application possible.
